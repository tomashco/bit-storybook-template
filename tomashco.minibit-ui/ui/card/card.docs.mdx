## React Component for rendering a Card

A basic card that renders props

### Component usage

```js
<Card
  imgSrc="https://randomwordgenerator.com/img/picture-generator/54e1d3424d52ad14f1dc8460962e33791c3ad6e04e507440722d72d59144cd_640.jpg"
  title="The first"
  text="this is card 1"
/>
```

### Using props to customize the text

Modify the props to see it change live:

```js live
<Card
  imgSrc="https://randomwordgenerator.com/img/picture-generator/54e1d3424d52ad14f1dc8460962e33791c3ad6e04e507440722d72d59144cd_640.jpg"
  title="This is a generic card"
  text="and here is some text too"
/>
```
